For this week's assignment I chose to do the thumbs up and down workshop. I followed the demo provided in the class with LEDs as the output worked fine. As an extension to this workshop, I decided to add an additional output in the p5 webpage. For a simple demonstration, I added thumbs up and down emojis as a response to the ML classification result. To fit the emoji and the video side by side, the video i rendered in a smaller resolution than the one in the workshop. Overall, the response is quite accurate and responds fast after the stimulus is presented. Here is a short demo:

In addition to LEDs attached to my arduino board, I am also interested in the output being a web based. This week's assignment was a small demonstration for that.
