Sign Language to Text:

The final goal is to be able to successfully translate sign language to text and audio in real time.

After completing the workshops in class, I thought itâ€™d be cool and helpful to be able to translate sign language to text and audio in real time. Upon some background research, I noticed that there are a couple of translators in the market but this domain needs more project contributions to reach a point where such translation is as seamless as translating other languages.

Given the time constraints, this project will focus on training the ASL alphabet in order to be able to spell out words.
