For this week's assignment, I chose to do the hand pose tracking + KNN Classification. I used the [p5 scketch]() provided in the tutorial to train the KNN model to classify 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissor' hand poses. Using the webcam as the input, the sketch classifies the poses into the afore mentioned three categories. Upon recieving the predictions, I added emojis to the video based on the prediction results. 

Here is a short demo:
